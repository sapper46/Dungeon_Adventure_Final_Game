Hi there!

This is the final executable program from a project I worked on in University of Washington courses TCSS 502 and 504.

To play the game, download all of the files here to the SAME FOLDER anywhere on your computer. (You should be able to download everything as a zip file by clicking on the green "Code" button.)

Double click on "Main.exe" to start the game!

The rules are simple:
(1) Navigate the maze.
(2) Kill monsters.
(3) Collect all the Pillar potions.
(4) Use health potions to heal.
(5) Use a vision potion to reveal the maze.
(6) Find the exit and win!
